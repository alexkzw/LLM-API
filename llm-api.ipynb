      "The predicted global economic impact of AI on employment is a complex and multifaceted topic. While AI has the potential to bring significant benefits, such as increased productivity and efficiency, it also poses significant challenges for workers and the labor market. Here are some predictions and estimates:\n",
      "\n",
      "1. **Job displacement**: According to a report by the McKinsey Global Institute, up to 800 million jobs could be lost worldwide due to automation by 2030. Another report by the World Economic Forum estimates that by 2022, more than a third of the desired skills for most jobs will be comprised of skills that are not yet considered crucial to the job today.\n",
      "2. **Job creation**: However, while AI may displace some jobs, it is also expected to create new ones. A report by the World Economic Forum estimates that by 2022, 75 million jobs may be displaced by automation, but 133 million new jobs may be created.\n",
      "3. **Net job loss**: Despite the creation of new jobs, the net impact of AI on employment is still expected to be negative. A report by the Institute for Public Policy Research estimates that the UK alone could lose up to 20% of its workforce to automation by 2030.\n",
      "4. **Skills shift**: AI is expected to change the skills required for many jobs. A report by the McKinsey Global Institute estimates that by 2030, 60% of occupations will require skills that are not yet considered crucial to the job today.\n",
      "5. **Industry impact**: Some industries are expected to be more heavily impacted by AI than others. For example, a report by the International Labor Organization estimates that the manufacturing sector could lose up to 30% of its workforce to automation by 2030.\n",
      "\n",
      "**Predicted impact by sector:**\n",
      "\n",
      "1. **Transportation**: 50-70% of jobs could be displaced by automation (e.g., self-driving cars).\n",
      "2. **Manufacturing**: 30-50% of jobs could be displaced by automation (e.g., robotics).\n",
      "3. **Customer service**: 30-50% of jobs could be displaced by automation (e.g., chatbots).\n",
      "4. **Bookkeeping and accounting**: 20-30% of jobs could be displaced by automation (e.g., automated accounting software).\n",
      "5. **Healthcare**: 10-20% of jobs could be displaced by automation (e.g., medical imaging analysis).\n",
      "\n",
      "**Key regions:**\n",
      "\n",
      "1. **Asia-Pacific**: Expected to be heavily impacted by AI, with up to 50% of jobs displaced in some countries (e.g., China, Japan).\n",
      "2. **Europe**: Expected to be moderately impacted, with up to 30% of jobs displaced (e.g., UK, Germany).\n",
      "3. **North America**: Expected to be relatively less impacted, with up to 20% of jobs displaced (e.g., US, Canada).\n",
      "\n",
      "**Mitigating the impact:**\n",
      "\n",
      "1. **Upskilling and reskilling**: Governments, educational institutions, and employers can invest in programs that help workers develop new skills.\n",
      "2. **Social safety nets**: Governments can implement policies to support workers who lose their jobs due to automation, such as basic income guarantees or job retraining programs.\n",
      "3. **Encouraging entrepreneurship**: Governments can create an environment that encourages entrepreneurship and innovation, which can lead to the creation of new jobs.\n",

      "The impact of artificial intelligence (AI) on the economy is multifaceted and can be understood through various frameworks. According to the provided reference, AI can be considered both a \"General Purpose Technology\" (GPT) and an \"Invention of a Method of Invention\" (IMI). A GPT has a wide range of applications, while an IMI raises productivity in the production of new ideas in research and innovation.\n",
      "\n",
      "From a macroeconomic perspective, AI can be thought of as a form of capital deepening, improving the quantity and quality of capital inputs. It can also be thought of as labor-augmenting technology that improves the quality of labor inputs.\n",
      "\n",
      "From a microeconomic perspective, AI can be seen as a form of workplace automation. A useful framework that summarizes the potential changes in the distribution and scope of tasks in production is presented by Acemoglu and Restrepo (2019). They identify three types of effects: the Displacement Effect, the Reinstatement Effect, and the Productivity Effect.\n",
      "\n",
      "Estimates suggest significant potential for productivity gains from AI, and from generative AI in particular. Briggs and Kodnani (2023) estimate that generative AI could increase labor productivity growth by 0.3 to 2.9 percentage points over ten years, with a central estimate of 1.5 points. Chui et al. (2023) suggest that generative AI could enable annual labor productivity growth of 0.1 to 0.6 percentage points annually from 2023 to 2040.\n",
      "\n",
      "However, the net impact of AI on labor demand and share depends on the balance between displacement and reinstatement. Briggs and Kodnani (2023) suggest that the short-term employment impacts might be modest, with around 7% of workers in the United States being fully displaced, but most finding new employment in only slightly less productive positions.\n",
      "\n",
      "Regarding regulatory approaches, there is a consensus on the principles that should govern AI, including human control, transparency, safety, accountability, non-discrimination, and privacy. New Zealand's regulatory approach for AI will need to consider the implications for Māori and Te Tiriti o Waitangi.\n",
      "\n",
      "The document also highlights the need for further research in areas such as policy levers to accelerate the diffusion of AI, the impacts of AI on the productivity and competitiveness of particular sectors, and the implications of AI for employment and labor markets.\n",
